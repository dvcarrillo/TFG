\chapter{Product Analysis}

The aim of this chapter is to provide a detailed analysis of the devices more closely related to this project, now that we have a 
clearer idea about its main pillars. I will go into many of the available commercial devices and software in the fields of home 
automation, voice assistance and smart devices. By comparing them, I hope to get the best technologies I can implement in
the final outcome of this project.

\section{Home Automation Systems}
This section covers all the hardware and software systems related to home automation. As we will see, there are lots of solutions
with very different purposes: while there is Amazon Alexa, a full hardware and software system that integrates other home automation
systems, we can also find pure online solutions, like the automation platform IFTTT.
