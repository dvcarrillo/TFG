%	PURPOSE (in Structure and Approached document):
%	
%	The Internet of Things or IoT is a relatively new concept that is slowly acquiring a great relevance in technology, as now it is possible 
%	to produce tiny devices that can connect between them and work together to create a big technological environment.
%	
%	At the same time, home automation is also a concept that is beginning to be real for many people thanks to these devices. However, 
%	the more I knew about it, the more I realized about the fact that it is lacking some things. First of all, many companies are only 
%	compatible with their own devices, so the communication between devices from different companies is not possible, which is pretty 
%	limiting. Secondly, it is still generally expensive, so right now itâ€™s not likely to popularize until their prices come down.
%	
%	As the objective of this project is creating an affordable and effective solution for home automation, after considering all the possibilities, we went for OpenHAB, as it is a software able to integrate different home automation systems and it is open source, so we would be able to perform all the modifications we need to do.
