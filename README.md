### Abstract
The main goal of this project is the creation of a low-cost, voice-driven home automation controller in a embedded system, such as the Raspberry Pi, using open source technologies and trying to obtain maximum compatibility with minimum cost.

To achieve this, I have analyzed the current state of the sector, distinguishing between domotic devices, voice assistants and home automation oriented systems. Through Software Engineering, I have studied the possible necessities of the users, trying to make up for the scarcities in this sector. Finally, I show an implementation of a home automation system in a real environment, usable and extensible to any daily situation.

Therefore, this project tries to demonstrate the infinite opportunities that the recent field of domotics enables, and the possibility of creating low-cost functional home automation systems.
